### Textbook & Other Resources


### Schedule


#### (A?)Sychronous?, Remote?, Recordings?

This course is designed for synchronous, in-person interaction.
That said, life happens, so we will make _best-effort_ attempts to stream the lectures via Zoom.

**TODO:** Due to the potentially sensitive nature, will not record (should we even stream?).

Please be sure to review the [Participation](#15-participation-peer-instruction) section in detail as well.


#### Office Hours


### Grading

A quick reminder: Effective learning comes from **active engagement** and **re-enforcement**.
Activities, assignments, and grading are designed to help with this.

_You get out of class what you put into it._


#### Final Grades

I believe in mastery learning. My goal is to teach you the material and for
everyone to learn it. I am most successful if everyone in class _earns_ an `A`.
This class will not be curved.

[CAPE response rate](https://cape.ucsd.edu/responses/current.aspx)
is >=90.0%, we will

### Academic Integrity

**TODO: Think about what the goal is to say here; group-heavy work...**

**TODO: This will also probably need a section, likely earlier(?), on
expectations for interaction, etc.**

## Resources for Students

<!-- fold this temporarily -->
<details markdown="1">
### Getting Help
First, try to make sure you help yourself by staying up to date with course material. Nearly half the grade is participation and homeworks, which are not meant to be tricky, simply to give you practice and confidence with the material.
We also encourage forming study groups to discuss 141 material.
In addition to our homework assigments, there are quite a few good problems at
the end of each chapter of the course textbook. Trying extra / similar-looking
problems (especially with your study group) is perfectly acceptable, and you
may discuss extra problems you work on with no limitations.

**Discussion section** is an opportunity for additional explanation and guided
practice with material from each week. Professor Pannuto did not go to any
discussions in their first two years of college becuase discussions were
&ldquo;not required&rdquo; and no one ever really explained what they were or
why they were helpful. Professor Pannuto got dragged to a discussion section
for a theory and cryptography course by a friend to whom they are forever
grateful at the end of sophomore year, realized how insanely helpful
discussions were, and had significantly better grades thereafter.

**Office hours** are the perfect place for one-on-one support and asking specific
questions. Office hours are most useful after you have worked on the problem for
a little while yourself (I usually say that you should struggle with a problem
for fifteen full minutes, but not more than fifteen minutes before seeking help).
You are not interrupting course staff (TAs _or_ the professors) when you come to
office hours. It is _literally_ our job to be available to help you during those
times. Office hours are also not restricted to content from 141. Folks have asked
about research / grad school in CS, how to get jobs in computer architecture,
what other classes to take if they like (or hate!) this stuff, the best coffee
shops for working accessible by light rail, tips for developing fruit-bearing
trees in San Diego, or anything else that you would like to know about.

**The IDEA Engineering Student Center**, located just off the lobby of Jacobs
Hall, is a hub for student engagement, academic enrichment,
personal/professional development, leadership, community involvement, and a
respectful learning environment for all.  The Center offers a variety of
programs, listed in the IDEA Center Facebook page at
http://www.facebook.com/ucsdidea/ and the Center web site at
http://idea.ucsd.edu/.  The IDEA Center programs support both undergraduate
students and graduate students.

### Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to fostering a learning environment for this course that
supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and respects
your identities (including race, ethnicity, heritage, gender, sex, class,
sexuality, religion, ability, age, educational background, etc.).  Our goal is
to create a diverse and inclusive learning environment where all students feel
comfortable and can thrive.

Our instructional staff will make a concerted effort to be welcoming and
inclusive to the wide diversity of students in this course.  If there is a way
we can make you feel more included please let one of the course staff know,
either in person, via email/discussion board, or even in a note under the door.
Our learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing process,
and we welcome your perspectives and input.

We also expect that you, as a student in this course, will honor and respect
your classmates, abiding by the
[UCSD Principles of Community](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html).
Please understand that others’ backgrounds, perspectives and experiences may be
different than your own, and help us to build an environment where everyone is
respected and feels comfortable.
If you experience any sort of harassment or discrimination, please contact the
instructor as soon as possible.   If you prefer to speak with someone outside
of the course, please contact the
[Office of Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination](https://ophd.ucsd.edu/).


### Students with Disabilities
We aim to create an environment in which all students can succeed in this course.  If you have a disability, please contact the Office for Students with Disability (OSD), which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall, to discuss appropriate accommodations right away.  We will work to provide you with the accommodations you need, but you must first provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter issued by the OSD.  You are required to present their AFA letters to Faculty (please make arrangements to contact me privately) and to the OSD Liaison in the department in advance so that accommodations may be arranged.

### Basic Needs/Food Insecurities
If you are experiencing any basic needs insecurities (food, housing, financial resources), there are resources available on campus to help, including The Hub and the Triton Food Pantry.
Please visit [thehub.ucsd.edu](/http://thehub.ucsd.edu/) for more information.
